# wp-dummy-twig
wp-dummy-twig is a starter theme designed to help you build Wordpress websites in a sane environment. It's main purpose is to provide a solid template system to keep the html away from the PHP, while keeping your sanity healty dealing with the `function.php`.

It is based on [Timber](https://github.com/jarednova/timber) powered by the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).

# Features
## Wordpress configuration
To prevent the creation of a big messy `function.php`, wp-dummy-twig is packed with helper classes and a well [structured php](https://github.com/dummy-team/wp-dummy-twig/tree/master/lib).

## Back-end editing
We like to provide the website contributors a rich layout system with a fully editable front-end, to do so we use [Visual composer](http://vc.wpbakery.com/). [Reusable components](dummy-team/wp-components) (*shortcodes*) will be available soon.

## Timber & Twig
To ease the sustainability of your views, Timber is based on Twig. The template files structure reflects the Wordpress scheme. Twig files use `blocks` and `includes` to keep everything DRY. Commonly used templates: posts, header, footer, single... are already packed And because most websites needs navigation and pagination they are both included.

## Front-end
To manage styles and scripts you can use any css frameworks you like. They will live in the web folder. We recommend our own solution :wink:, the [dummy](dummy-team.github.io/dummy/) which provide a powerful automated frame around the ITCSS principles. [Visual composer](http://vc.wpbakery.com/) use the [Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).

# Install
## Requirements
First you'll need to [install Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) then get the [Timber plugin](https://github.com/jarednova/timber#installation).
While it isn't required, the [Visual composer plugin](http://vc.wpbakery.com/) works very well with wp-dummy-twig.

## Get it from github
To install this starter theme download [sources](https://github.com/dummy-team/wp-dummy-twig/archive/master.tar.gz) from github and extract it in your worpdress theme folder, then activate it.

# Usage
## Configuration
The lib folder will host all the Wordpress php configuration usually found in the `function.php`.

## Custom contents
To ease the *shortcodes* use, all of our components are provided with the Visual Composer back-end configuration, it allow your contributors to manage advanced content without any coding knowledges.

To manage additional content fields, Timber works great with [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

## View integration
The view folder contains Twig layouts, templates and partials. This is also where you'll find the *shortcodes* configuration and templates.

## Front-end development
The web folder is were you'll put your front-end framework & resources: styles, scripts and images. The dummy can be put as it is with a minimal configuration. Either edit the `parameters.coffee` or create a `parameters_local.coffee` in the grunt folder:
``` coffeescript
# {theme folder}/web/grunt/parameters_local.coffee
module.exports =
  sync:
    # Files which trigger a browser reload
    files: [
      '../*.html'
      '../css/*.css'
      '../js/*.js'
      '../img/**'
      '../../**.twig'
      '../../**.php'
    ]
    # Start a basic file server
    server: false
    # Use an existing server (apache,node...)
    proxy: 'dummy.wordpress.local'
    # Open browser on server start
    open: false
```
